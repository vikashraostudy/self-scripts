Here’s a more comprehensive **user management script** with **all possible tasks** related to managing users in **Oracle Linux**, **Kali Linux**, and **Ubuntu WSL** environments. It includes all essential operations like creating, modifying, and deleting users, as well as advanced tasks such as locking/unlocking accounts, changing shells, setting expiration dates, and more. I’ve also added detailed comments for each step.

### **Comprehensive Explanation of Each Feature:**

1. **Create User (`create_user`)**:
   - Creates a new user and prompts for setting the password.

2. **Modify User (`modify_user`)**:
   - Allows modifications to an existing user, including:
     - Changing the password.
     - Adding the user to a group.
     - Changing the default shell.
     - Locking or unlocking the account.
     - Setting an account expiration date.
     - Changing the full name (GECOS field).

3. **Delete User (`delete_user`)**:
   - Deletes a user and removes their home directory.

4. **Show User Details (`show_user_details`)**:
   - Displays user details such as their user ID, group ID, groups they belong to, and password expiration information.

5. **List All Users (`list_all_users`)**:
   - Lists all users on the system by reading `/etc/passwd`.

6. **Find User's Groups (`find_user_groups`)**:
   - Displays all groups a user belongs to.

7. **Set Password Expiration (`set_password_expiration`)**:
   - Sets a limit on how many days after which the user's password will expire, prompting them to reset it.

8. **Disable User Login Temporarily (`disable_user_login`)**:
   - Locks a user's account, preventing them from logging in.

### **Usage Instructions:**

1. Save this script to a file, for example `complete_user_management.sh`.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x complete_user_management.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./complete_user_management.sh
   ```

### **Comments**:

- **Create User**: Creates a user with `useradd -m`, sets a password using `passwd`.
- **Modify User**: Provides options for modifying the user, including adding to a group, changing shell, locking/unlocking the account, and setting expiration.
- **Delete User**: Removes the user and their home directory with `userdel -r`.
- **Show User Details**: Shows ID and password information with `id` and `chage -l`.
- **List Users**: Lists all users using `cut` on `/etc/passwd`.
- **Groups**: Finds all groups a user belongs to using `groups`.
- **Set Password Expiration**: Uses `chage -M` to set the password expiration time.
- **Disable User Login**: Locks the user’s account temporarily with `usermod -L`.

This script now includes **all essential user management tasks** and is fully commented for clarity. It will help you manage users in a consistent manner across **Oracle Linux**, **Kali Linux**, and **Ubuntu on WSL**.
